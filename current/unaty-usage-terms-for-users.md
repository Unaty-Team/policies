These Terms of Use for Users (the &quot;Terms of Use&quot;) govern your access to our online platform and related services. In particular, these User Terms also apply to you if you are invited to join an existing community as a member.

**Welcome to Unaty.**

## Reference to definitions of contractual objects, roles, and processes

This Agreement refers to the definitions explained in these pages, they are annex and thus part of this Agreement. In particular, it should be noted that user includes all users of the online services and invited members of communities.

## Liability

These Terms of Use are a legally binding contract between you and us. Under these Terms of Use, you agree to abide by the most recent version of our Unaty + Community Code of Conduct, which is referenced in these Terms of Use. If you access or use the Services, or you continue to use the Services after being notified of a change to the Terms of Use or the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct, you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct. &quot;We,&quot; &quot;our(s),&quot; and &quot;us&quot; as of the current date refers to the relevant Unaty entity as outlined in the Overview and Definitions.

## Commitment to customer decisions for members

As a user, you are either a user of the general Unaty platform or part of a community.

If you are part of a community, the community is managed by an organization (&quot;the customer&quot;), represented by the &quot;Owner&quot;.

The customer has separately agreed to our Terms of Service for Customers or entered a written contract with us (each, the &quot;Contract&quot;). This allows the customer to create and configure a community that you and others can join (all invitees granted access to the Services are &quot;Invited Members&quot;). The Agreement contains our written commitment to provide the Services to Customer, who may then invite Members to join his or her community. If an Invited Member submits content or information to the Services, such as messages, master data, or files (&quot;Member Data&quot;), you thereby acknowledge that the Member Data is data collected by Customer as Controller. The Agreement grants Customer numerous options and extensive control over this Member Data. For example, the customer may grant or revoke access rights to the Services, enable or disable integrations of third-party services, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer communities, or merge your community with other communities. These options or instructions may result in the access, use, disclosure, editing, or deletion of some or all Member Data. Customers may publish further specific terms regarding the collection and management of Member Data and may also make Member consent a condition of use.

## Business relationship between customers, users, and Unaty

You agree to the agreement between us and the customer that it is solely the customer&#39;s responsibility,

- Inform yourself and invited members of all relevant policies, terms, and settings regarding the lawful processing of member data,
- Obtain all consents from you and the Invited Members necessary for the lawful use of Member Data and the operation of the Services,
- ensure that the collection, transfer, and processing of member data under the contract is lawful; and
- Respond to and resolve any disputes with you and Invited Members relating to Member Data, the Services, or the failure of Customer to comply with these obligations itself (by Customer).

Unaty makes no representations or warranties, express or implied, to you regarding the Services, their condition, or their availability.

## General terms of use

### Legal capacity of the users

To the extent permitted by law, the Services are not intended for, and may not be used by, persons under the age of eighteen (18). You represent that you are of legal age and are the intended recipient of the customer&#39;s invitation to use the Services. You may only access or use the Services if the representations in the preceding sentence apply. Without limiting the foregoing, you must be of at least legal age in your respective jurisdiction.

### Acceptance of the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct.

For us to ensure safe online communities, all users and invited members are required to comply with our Unaty + Community Code of Conduct and any applicable policies that may additionally be set by the customer. If you notice inappropriate behavior or content, please report it to the owner of your community.

### Scope inside and outside communities

These Terms of Use apply to you both inside and outside of Communities on Unaty.

Within Communities, these Terms of Use will apply until the expiration or termination of Customer&#39;s subscription to you or until your access to the Services has been terminated by Customer. Please contact the Customer (or its representative on Unaty, the Owner of the Community) if you wish to cancel and delete your membership in a community at any time.

If you reject any updates to these Terms of Use or the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct, you will no longer be able to use the Unaty Services, either within a community or in the general Platform area.

### Intervention in the use in case of violations

If we believe that there has been a violation of this Agreement, the Terms of Service, the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct, or any of our other policies that can be remedied straightforwardly by the removal of certain Member Data or other action by the customer, we will, in most cases, ask the customer to take appropriate action rather than intervene ourselves. However, we reserve the right to intervene directly and take actions we deem appropriate (including disabling your access to the Services). This will only apply if the customer does not take appropriate action themselves or if we believe there is a risk to us, the Services, or third parties.

## Liability

In the course of Users&#39; or Members&#39; use of the Services, neither party shall be liable to the other for any lost revenue or profits or any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, regardless of causation, whether in contract, tort or any other theory of liability and regardless of whether the other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages occurring. Unless a User is also a Customer, such User shall not be financially liable to us for any breach of these Terms of Use. We shall be liable to the user for any violation of the Terms of Use up to a total amount not exceeding one hundred Euro (EUR 100). The foregoing disclaimers apply only to the extent permitted by law and are not intended to limit the rights of any party to seek remedies available to it in equity.

## Emails and Unaty messages

Unless otherwise provided herein, notices under this Agreement will be given by email. Alternatively, we may instead notify users through the Services (e.g., through a Unaty notification). Notices to Unaty shall be sent to hey@getunaty.com. Notice shall be deemed to have been duly given (a) in the case of notices by email, on the day after the email is sent, or (b) in the case of notices through the Services, on the day on which the notice is given.

## Privacy Policy

Our Unaty Data Privacy Policy for Users explains how we collect and use data about the use and performance of our products. The data processing agreement between us and the customer (i.e., the organization behind the community) specifies how the data that the customer collects about its members is processed by Unaty.

## Changes

As our business evolves, these Terms of Use or the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct may be amended. If we make material changes to our Terms of Use or the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct, we will notify you with reasonable advance notice, but at least one month before the intended effective date. The information will be sent to the email address designated by the user. If you do not agree with a change we intend to make, you have the right to object to the change within one month of notification. If you object in due time, we are entitled to terminate the access in writing with a notice period of one month to the end of the calendar month and thus terminate the use.

The current version of our Terms of Use can be viewed at any time on this and the following pages. Any material changes to these Terms of Use will become effective on the date specified in our notice. All other changes will be effective on the date the changes are posted. Use of the Services after the effective date of any amendment constitutes acceptance of the amended Terms of Use.

## Waiver of rights

A party&#39;s failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right to which it is entitled under the Terms of Use, including those of the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct, shall not constitute a waiver of such right. Declarations of waiver by a party of its rights under the Terms of Use shall be valid only if made in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the party believed to have made the waiver.

## Salvatory clause

The Terms of Use will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, that provision will be modified by the court and interpreted to achieve the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law. The validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use shall remain unaffected.

## Assignment

You may not assign or transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of your rights under these Terms of Use, including the Acceptable Use Policy, or any of the obligations hereunder, without our prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). We may assign these Terms of Use in their entirety (including any terms and conditions declared to be a part thereof) without your consent to an affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

## Governing Law; Venue; Fees

The following applies to the Terms of Use, including the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct: Place of performance and jurisdiction is Munich. German law applies to this contract.

All parties acknowledge and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the superior party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys&#39; fees.
