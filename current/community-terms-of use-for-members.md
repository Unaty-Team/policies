# **Community Terms of Use of the Customer for Members**

***

## Our Recommendation

We recommend that our customers, as organizations that open the use of Unaty to their members, draft their custom terms of use, publish them to their members on Unaty, and document their consent.
We are happy to assist you as a Unaty customer in drafting these terms of use, but please note that Unaty cannot or should not provide legal advice or counsel.
Please feel free to contact us at hey@getunaty.com


## Realization on Unaty (Policies Function)

Organizations can use Unaty Services to open policies to their members and document their members&#39; agreement with them.

**Contractual partners:** All members of a community and the customer, i.e., the organization behind the community on the online platform.  
**Content:** Regulation of community-specific rules of conduct  
**Conclusion process:** When you become a member of a community, the organization behind the community can demand that you agree to the terms of use. This can be done after confirming your application to join the community (process D) or when creating a user account after receiving an invitation (process E). Here you will be asked to read the terms of use and agree to them by checking the appropriate box.  
**Update process:** The organization behind the community will ask you to agree to changes the next time you log in. You can read everything at your leisure and agree again by checking the appropriate box.
