## **Preamble**
The Unaty Community Customer Data Processing Agreement is based on the Standard Contractual Clauses between Controllers and Processors published by the European Commission on 04 June 2021, pursuant to Article 28(7) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Article 29(7) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council. These standard contractual clauses consist of 3 sections (I, II, III) and 4 annexes (I, II, III, IV), which we have included unchanged in our Unaty contract.

All Unaty-specific binding definitions for this contract found [here](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/unaty-prod.appspot.com/o/policies%2Fcurrent%2Fdefinitions-en.md?alt=media) here.

(e) These Clauses are without prejudice to obligations to which the controller is subject by virtue of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

(f) These Clauses do not by themselves ensure compliance with obligations related to international transfers in accordance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.
### **Clause 2: Invariability of the clauses**
(a) The Parties undertake not to modify the Clauses, except for adding information to the Annexes or updating information in them.

(b) This does not prevent the Parties from including the standard contractual clauses laid down in these Clauses in a broader contract, or from adding other clauses or additional safeguards provided that they do not directly or indirectly contradict the Clauses or detract from the fundamental rights or freedoms of data subjects.
### **Clause 3: Interpretation**

The details of the processing operations, in particular the categories of personal data and the purposes of processing for which the personal data is processed on behalf of the controller, are specified in Annex II.
### **Clause 7: Obligations of the parties**
#### Clause 7.1: Instructions
(a) The processor shall process personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, unless required to do so by Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject. In this case, the processor shall inform the controller of that legal requirement before processing, unless the law prohibits this on important grounds of public interest. Subsequent instructions may also be given by the controller throughout the duration of the processing of personal data. These instructions shall always be documented.

(b) The processor shall immediately inform the controller if, in the processor’s opinion, instructions given by the controller infringe Regulation (EU) 2016/679 / Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 or the applicable Union or Member State data protection provisions
#### Clause 7.2: Purpose limitation
The processor shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the processing, as set out in Annex II, unless it receives further instructions from the controller.
#### Clause 7.3: Duration of the processing of personal data
Processing by the processor shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex II.
#### Clause 7.4: Security of processing
(a) The processor shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex III to ensure the security of the personal data. This includes protecting the data against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to the data (personal data breach). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing and the risks involved for the data subjects.

(b) The processor shall grant access to the personal data undergoing processing to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for implementing, managing and monitoring of the contract. The processor shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data received have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
#### Clause 7.5: Sensitive data
If the processing involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (“sensitive data”), the processor shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards.

(e) The Parties shall make the information referred to in this Clause, including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority/ies on request.
#### Clause 7.7: Use of subcontracted processors
(a) The processor has the controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processors from an agreed list. The processor shall specifically inform in writing the controller of any intended changes of that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 30 days in advance, thereby giving the controller sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the concerned sub-processor(s). The processor shall provide the controller with the information necessary to enable the controller to exercise the right to object.

(b) Where the processor engages a sub-processor for carrying out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller), it shall do so by way of a contract which imposes on the sub-processor, in substance, the same data protection obligations as the ones imposed on the data processor in accordance with these Clauses. The processor shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the processor is subject pursuant to these Clauses and to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and/or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

(c) At the controller’s request, the processor shall provide a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments to the controller.

(e) The processor shall agree a third party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby - in the event the processor has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the controller shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.
#### Clause 7.8: International transfers
(a) Any transfer of data to a third country or an international organisation by the processor shall be done only on the basis of documented instructions from the controller or in order to fulfil a specific requirement under Union or Member State law to which the processor is subject and shall take place in compliance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.

(b) The controller agrees that where the processor engages a sub-processor in accordance with Clause 7.7. for carrying out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller) and those processing activities involve a transfer of personal data within the meaning of Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the processor and the sub-processor can ensure compliance with Chapter V of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 by using standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with of Article 46(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, provided the conditions for the use of those standard contractual clauses are met.

## **Annex I: List of parties**
The responsible party is the customer, i.e. the organization behind the community. The contact person is the owner of the community as the authorized representative of the customer, who can be reached at the email address used to register with Unaty.

The processor is Unaty Technologies GmbH, Unertlstraße 27, D-80803 Munich. The contact person is the managing director with power of representation, Sean McCall.
## **Annex II: Description of the processing**
#### Categories of data subjects whose personal data are processed
- Unaty customers and their legal representatives (owners)
- Unaty Community Members (Member)
#### Categories of personal data that are processed
- Customer data for the proper processing of our business with customers:
  - Inventory data (e.g., names, addresses),
  - Contact information (e.g., email, phone numbers),
  - Contract data (e.g., subject matter of the contract, term, customer category),
  - Payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history) and
  - Usage data (e.g., number of emails sent, number of administrators, access times).
- Member data to ensure the services for data management on Unaty. These are collected by the customer from members and processed on Unaty. This includes:
  - Inventory data (e.g., names, addresses),
  - Contact information (e.g., email, phone numbers),
  - Usage data (e.g., number of emails sent, number of groups).
  - In addition, the Customer may specify other data fields that it collects from its Members, and Members have the freedom to provide additional information about themselves (for example, in the self-description on the profile or via the profile picture), so the Member Data processed by Unaty includes all information and content provided by Members. This includes all files, content, communications and other information that Members provide when they use our Services; this includes registration data for Member accesses, creating or sharing content, and messaging or communicating with others.
  - Beyond the explicitly contained information, this includes implicit data contained within them (for example, metadata), such as the location and times a data field was updated or the date a file was created.
- Our systems automatically process this data to analyze the context and details contained in it for the purposes described below and to fulfill the Services for the Customer.

Sensitive data processed and restrictions or safeguards applied that take full account of the nature of the data and the associated risks, e.g., strict purpose limitation, access restrictions (including access only to staff who have completed specific training), records of access to data, restrictions on onward transfers, or additional security measures

- Through Unaty data fields, customers may also collect membership data that includes information about religious beliefs, political attitudes or health, nationality, ethnic origin, ideological beliefs or trade union membership.
#### Type of processing
All data that Unaty processes as a processor is processed solely for the purpose of ensuring our contractual services and processing the contracts. This means that we structure the data collected via the services and the web application by the customer, also aggregate and merge it depending on the service, and transfer it to our infrastructure service providers for storage. Here we have the data stored and further processed, for example to provide further services from the data such as creating a group based on a data field or sending an email to an age segment of members. The sub-data order processors from Appendix IV are used for this purpose.
#### Purposes for which the personal data are processed on behalf of the controller
The collection and processing of customer data (such as inventory data, contact data or contract data) are carried out for the purpose of contract management between Unaty and its customers in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 1, 1b DSGVO.

The Client and Responsible Party may collect all types of Member Data through Unaty Services for several purposes, including, but not limited to.

- Member Data Management,
- Member Service and Maintenance,
- Organization and implementation events,
- Design regular notifications and newsletters to member groups,
- Analyses of membership structure and member interests,
- Recruitment of new members and acquisition, as well as promotion of the organization for image purposes,
- Inclusion and admission of new members and
- Systematic improvement of the organization's content, subject areas, event and offerings.

This collection and processing should generally serve the purpose of fulfilling the contractual obligations and services of the customer organization arising from the membership in accordance with Article 6(1), 1b of the GDPR. If the collection goes beyond these purposes, it should be preceded by clear consent from the member in accordance with Article 6(1)(1a) of the GDPR.
#### Processing duration
The processing takes place in each case for the duration of the commissioning of Unaty and its services by the customer, beyond that only to ensure the data transport or export on behalf of the customer.
## **Annex III: Technical and organizational measures, including to ensure the security of data**
#### Measures for identifying and authorizing users of the services
Unaty implements procedures for secure identification and authentication of its users to allow only authorized access to data. This includes minimum requirements for password length and components, password actuality. A two-factor authentication option is currently being planned.
#### Measures to protect against unauthorized access by Unaty employees
Unatys employees do not have access to the services and data within community instances.

Unaty's internal data access processes and policies are designed to prevent unauthorized employees from gaining access to systems used to process personal data. This applies, for example, to the cloud infrastructure systems used to provide Unaty. Unaty uses a centralized privilege system here, so that usually only a single technical system administrator has infrastructure access.

All employees receive regular training on data protection topics and are aware of the fundamental importance of protecting personal data at Unaty.

All employees must sign confidentiality agreements, and particularly strict agreements apply to employees with infrastructure and back-end system access privileges.
#### Security of data in the technical infrastructure of Unaty and its sub-processors.
Unaty ensures that all providers it engages for its technical infrastructure have implemented the following technical and organizational measures:

- The infrastructure used is based on geographically distributed data centers.
- Used infrastructure systems have been designed to eliminate single points of failure and minimize the impact of anticipated environmental risks. Duplicate circuits, switches, networks, or other necessary equipment help provide this redundancy.
- Used infrastructure services are secured through preventive and corrective maintenance of data centers.
- The power supply systems of the infrastructure systems used are designed to be redundant and can be maintained 24 hours a day, 7 days a week without affecting continuous operation
- Used servers use a Linux-based implementation adapted to the application environment. Data is stored using proprietary algorithms to increase data security and redundancy.
- All infrastructure service providers have developed, and regularly plan and test, business continuity planning and disaster recovery programs.
- Used infrastructure services have data centers connected via high-speed private links to ensure secure and fast data transfer between data centers
- All infrastructure service providers rely on multiple layers of network devices and intrusion detection to protect its external attack surface.
- All infrastructure service providers provide HTTPS encryption (also known as SSL or TLS connection). These methods help protect traffic and minimize the impact of a compromised key or cryptographic breach.
- All infrastructure service providers maintain on-site security services, which is responsible for all physical security functions of the data center around the clock
- All infrastructure service providers have physically protected the data centers in such a way that only authorized employees, contractors and authorized visitors can access the data centers. All infrastructure service providers log unauthorized activities and failed access attempts via an access control system and investigated if necessary.
- Unaty's central infrastructure service providers store data in a multi-tenant environment on their own servers. They logically isolate customer data.
- All infrastructure service providers ensure effective data destruction, including multi-step deletions and multiple independent verification of the completeness of deletion
