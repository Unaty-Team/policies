# **Community Data Privacy Policy of the Customer for Members**

***

## Our Recommendation

We recommend that our customers, as organizations that collect and manage their member data via Unaty, draft their own privacy policy, publish it to their members on Unaty, and document member consent.
We are happy to assist you as a Unaty customer in drafting these terms of use, but please note that Unaty cannot or should not provide legal advice or counsel.
Please feel free to contact us at hey@getunaty.com


## Realization on Unaty (Policies Function)

Organizations can use Unaty Services to disclose to their members what personal data about their members they collect and process using Unaty Services and document consent to do so.

**Contractual partners:** All members of a community and the customer, i.e. the organization behind the community on the online platform.  
**Content:** Consent to the collection and processing of personal data in the community by the organization. This also includes commissioned processing by the organization&#39;s service providers, for example, Unaty.  
**Closing process:** When you become a member of a community, the organization behind the community asks you to agree to the privacy policy. This can be done after confirming your application to join the community (process D) or when creating a user account after receiving an invitation (process E). Here you will be asked to read the privacy policy and agree to it by checking the appropriate box.  
**Update process:** The organization behind the community will ask you to agree to changes the next time you log in. You can read everything at your leisure and agree again by checking the appropriate box.
