## Welcome to Unaty!

To ensure a smooth collaboration where you can rely on Unaty and we can rely on you, we have put together these pages. When we work together, you assume a role in relation to Unaty (=process). By assuming or changing your role, you enter certain contracts with us as a company. We want to clearly state here what your and our rights and obligations are in these roles. For now, here are some definitions that are binding for all subsequent documents and contracts.

## Definitions

![V1_Unaty-Explainer_EN](./images/V1_Unaty-Explainer_EN.jpg)

### Subjects and objects

#### We = Unaty Technologies (1)

When we write &quot;Unaty&quot; or &quot;We&quot; (and respectively &quot;us&quot;) on the following pages, we mean Unaty Technologies GmbH, Unertlstra√üe 27, D-80803 Munich, Germany, and its affiliates. You can find more information about the affiliated companies and their websites in the respective section of this page.

#### Unaty online platform with services (2)

Unaty offers a software solution to support member organizations and makes it available for use via the Internet on their websites as a web application (online platform). We refer to the concrete functional scope of the software we offer as &quot;services&quot;.

#### Community = The Unaty instance of your organization on our online platform (3)

A community is an instance of our online platform Unaty and a dedicated virtual working environment for an organization to use the services. A Community represents an organization, i.e., a legal entity, on Unaty. A Community is created by an authorized or empowered representative of the organization, the Owner (5). There must be at least one owner per community.

#### Customer = The organization that uses the community (4)

There can be only one customer per community. If the organization is represented by the creator of the community, then that organization is the customer. By agreeing to our contracts, the creator of a community declares that is authorized to represent or is authorized by the organization for which the community is intended. Examples of authorization for this form of representation could be the position of President, Board of Directors for IT, or Member Management. If this is not the case, for example, if the creator is not formally affiliated with the organization for which you are creating a community, then you are our customer as a private individual (natural person). This special case is specifically addressed in the terms and conditions for customers.

### Roles

These roles are legal and technical subjects of the Unaty platform and should not be confused with the customizable roles that customers can create and use within the communities.

#### Owner = The person authorized by the customer to manage the community (5)

When you create a community, you are assigned the role of &quot;owner&quot; of the community. If the customer is an organization, the owner is always the representative of the customer or organization who signs this contract for the customer. The Owner role can be assigned to another representative of the customer. The role of the Owner includes special administrative rights for the Community, which include closing the Community and deleting all Community data. If the customer chooses to replace You as the representative with ultimate Owner authority for the Community, we will notify you accordingly upon such decision. You agree to take actions reasonably requested by us or the Customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of Customer. If you are our customer as an individual, then the role of Owner is synonymous with the customer.

#### Administrator = Owner-appointed administrator of data and services in the community (6)

Administrators are technical administrators of the customer&#39;s community instance on Unaty and help manage data and services and maintain member data, groups, roles, and settings. They are not legal representatives of the owner, only the owner represents the customer, i.e., the organization behind the community, legally on the platform and in the services.

#### Members = Unaty users with access to a community (7) and (8)

Members are part of a community on Unaty without having special additional legal responsibilities there. Independently of this, they can of course be given certain rights and tasks within the community, which are defined by the owner and administrators. It is irrelevant whether you are formally part of the organization outside of Unaty (7), which is represented as a community on Unaty or not (8) - by invitation or permission of the Unaty customer behind a community, you are an authorized member of the community on Unaty.

Behind each community is a customer, either an organization or an individual, who has certain responsibilities for the members who belong to it.

#### Unaty users without community membership (9)

Outside of the communities, there is an online platform on Unaty called the Unaverse. This is a public area where you can make settings and explore the public profiles of communities. For some of them, you can even apply for membership directly. In any case, you are a user of our online platform even without being a member of a community.

#### Visitors to our website, Visitor (10)

When you visit our website getunaty.com, you are a visitor - even without registering or logging in as a user. Welcome to our website! We will ask you if we may store certain settings of you via cookies and learn anonymously from your use of the website in order to improve it. Thank you!

#### You = representative (5) of the customer (4), user (9), or visitor of our website (10)

When we address you as &quot;You&quot; (and respectively &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Your(s)&quot; &quot;You&quot;) on the following pages, we are addressing you in your respective roles as a contractual partner of Unaty. These roles are either the direct representative (5) of the customer or organization (4), the member authorized by invitation or permission of a community (7 or 8, as a user (9) of our platform without membership, or as a visitor to our website (10). At the beginning of each contract, it is again clearly stated who we mean and address with personal pronouns. All personal pronouns at Unaty are genderless.
