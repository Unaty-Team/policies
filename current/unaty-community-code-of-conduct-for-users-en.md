## Our binding Code of Conduct = This is how we want to work together

1. **Our respect for human dignity and the law**  
_Unaty and its customers are committed to respecting human dignity and the law. As a company, we will enforce this commitment to the best of our ability with our customers - just as we expect our customers to enforce this commitment to the best of their ability in their Unaty communities. Respect for applicable law is derived from the particular state law that applies to us and to you as a customer. What we specifically mean by violations of human dignity, especially when dealing with each other on the Internet, can be found below._
2. **Your community, your data**  
_Unaty does not want to appropriate the data of your community. Especially the personal data of the members should belong solely to the respective community. So that this does not remain an empty phrase, every customer on Unaty is also legally the GDPR controller for the data of his community and Unaty is only his GDPR processor. More about your data ownership under data protection._
3. **Security for you and the members of your community**  
_Unaty takes technical and organizational measures to the best of its ability to protect the integrity of our platform and the user access created within it. We expect our customers for their communities and each user to use Unaty only in a way that these measures are not compromised or circumvented._
4. **Independence of your community from Unaty**  
_We know that there are many other products that you can use to organize your community. If one of them is better for this than Unaty, that&#39;s fine. We will never make it hard for you to leave Unaty. That&#39;s why we are committed to making Unaty so that all data can be exported easily and all services can be canceled in reasonably short periods. If Unaty is ever forced to discontinue its online platform or certain services, customers will be notified on time and the respective source code will be released under an open-source license._
5. **Privacy for you and the members of your community**  
_We find that many software companies systematically exploit the privacy of their customers. Their business model is sometimes even based on violating it. Not at Unaty: We do not want to - and cannot - view, evaluate, make available to third parties or sell the personal data of your members in your community. We will show you exactly which data will remain within your community and which you will make public. We will also ask you to allow us to analyze the data anonymously in order to further develop our services - that&#39;s it._
6. **The Unaty Communities business model**  
_Unaty Communities is offered as Software as a Service. There are many business models in this industry, but we believe only one is fair for communities: a good price for using a good software. We therefore offer our services to customers, i.e., communities, via paid subscriptions._
7. **Your needs and our features**  
_We believe that communities can only be successful if they listen to their members and implement what they learn from their members in short feedback cycles. We want to listen to you as customers and users in the same way. You don&#39;t like something? You wanted something new? Please let us know! We try to make our decision process on new services as transparent as possible. By the way: If you like something, we like to hear about it, too._
8. **Uncomplicated and friendly help**  
_We are just four guys developing good software at the moment. We will always help you using Unaty and we will do it as friendly and uncomplicated as we can. Due to our distribution in several time zones, this is possible around the clock! We expect our users to return our kindness and courtesy - thank you!_

_**Welcome to Unaty** - we hope for much success together!_

#### Prohibited purposes for using Unaty = If you have these intentions, don&#39;t use Unaty for them - it&#39;s best not to!

We are proud of Unaty&#39;s online platform and how we use it to help organizations. However, we recognize that no matter how good the creator&#39;s intentions, technology can have the ability to do great harm. For this reason, we have established this Code of Conduct. We feel ethically obligated to counteract such harm: both in terms of dealing with cases where Unaty is used (and abused) to promote such harm, and to state unequivocally that Unaty is not a safe place for people to commit such harm. If you have access to our online platform, you must not use it for any of the prohibited purposes listed below. If we find out that you are doing so, we will take appropriate action and exclude you and your organization from using our platform and services.

The list of prohibited purposes also includes methods peculiar to the Internet of violating respect for human dignity and the law, which we expect from all customers and users under ยง1 of our Code of Conduct. If necessary, we have also briefly explained these methods.

Although our prohibited purposes are quite broad, they cannot be exhaustive - an offense may defy categorization, occur for the first time, or involve a moral dilemma that we have not yet considered. Nevertheless, we hope the overarching meaning is clear: Unaty must not be used to harm others, whether mentally or physically, personally or socially. Different viewpoints - philosophical, religious, and political - are welcome here, but ideologies or movements based on oppression, violence, abuse, or domination of one group over another are not accepted here.

Specifically, we hereby prohibit the use of Unaty for the following purposes:

- **Violence, or threats thereof** : If an activity is considered a crime of violence in the Federal Republic of Germany, the United States of America, or where you live, you may not use Unaty Services to plan, commit or threaten to commit that activity.
- **Sexual Exploitation and Abuse, Especially of Minors, Including Sexualizing Them:** We do not condone activities that involve, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse. Never use our Services in a way that could harm minors or inappropriately targets individuals who are not of legal age. Filing or distributing media created under the sexual exploitation of minors is also among the prohibited purposes.
- **Doxing** : You may not use Unaty Services to store or disclose other people&#39;s private or personal information for the purpose of harassment.
- **Malware or Spyware** : Do not use Unaty Services to upload or transmit data, files, software, or links that contain or redirect to viruses, Trojan horses, worms, or other harmful components, or that contain or redirect to technologies that unlawfully download or disable access to content or data stored on the Services or Unaty or third-party hardware.
- **Phishing or Other Fraud** : It is prohibited to use Unaty to lie about your identity or employment in order to steal from, extort, or otherwise harm others.
- **Spamming** : Nobody wants unsolicited commercial emails. We do not tolerate users (including their bots) using Unaty Services for spamming purposes. If your emails do not meet the requirements of CAN-SPAM or other anti-spam laws, you must not send them through Unaty Services.
- **Cybersquatting:** Extortion of usernames on Unaty is prohibited. If you set up a Unaty community under the name of another person or organization and then try to sell that community to that person or organization, it is cybersquatting. We will terminate cybersquatting communities with immediate effect.
- **Infringement of Intellectual Property:** Unaty may not be used to create or distribute works that infringe the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of fair use. This also applies to Unaty itself: Do not use our Services to create competing products or services or to copy any ideas, features, functions, or graphics of the Services.
