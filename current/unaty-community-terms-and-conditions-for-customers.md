## Preamble

These terms and conditions for customers (the &quot;Customer Terms&quot;) of Unaty Community describe your rights and obligations when using our online platform and related services. Please read them carefully. If you are a Customer (as defined below), these Customer Terms apply to your Community, your access to and use of our Services.

If you are invited to use a Community established by a Customer as a Member or are not in a Community, the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct and Terms of Use govern your use of the Services.

Welcome to Unaty.

## Reference to definitions of contractual objects, roles, and processes

This contract refers to the definitions explained in these pages, they are annex and therefore part of this contract.

## Subject of the contract

### Services on the Unaty online platform

We offer various services to support the management of membership data and member communication and make these available for use via the Internet as an online platform. This is a transfer of software in the cloud. The specific scope of functions of the services and the requirements for the hardware and software environment that must be met by the customer are set out in the respective offer and the user documentation. The provision of the services (on data carriers or by way of online transfer) for local installation (on premise) is not possible.

As part of the Services, cloud storage space is provided on which the data generated and processed by the Services can be stored for the duration of the contractual relationship. We only archive this data in accordance with the retention periods under commercial and tax law for debiting and remuneration purposes. The processing of all personal member and community data is regulated in the order processing agreement for customers.

The performance transfer point is the router output of the data center used by us to the Internet. The customer must take care of the connection to the Internet, the provision or maintenance of the network connection to the data center as well as the procurement and provision of network access components for the Internet on the customer side.

The Services are usually also available outside normal operating hours (365 days, 24 hours), but there is no entitlement to this. If, for urgent technical reasons that cannot be postponed, maintenance work is exceptionally required during the operating hours, with the consequence that the Services are not available during this time, we will, if possible, inform the Customer in good time by e-mail to the address provided by the Customer.

### Change of services and benefits

We are entitled to further develop, change or supplement the Services in part or in whole at any time. We will announce significant changes relevant to the contract by e-mail to the e-mail account specified by the customer at least six weeks before they take effect. The customer may object to the changes in writing or by e-mail with a period of notice of one month from receipt of the change notification. If the customer does not object, the changes shall become part of the contract. In the notification of change, the consequences of the objection will be pointed out accordingly. In the event of timely objection, we shall be entitled to terminate the contract in writing with one month&#39;s notice to the end of the calendar month.

In particular, the introduction of options to use Unaty subject to remuneration will represent a major change. We guarantee the continuation of a temporary remuneration-free usage option.

## Conclusion of contract

### Conclusion of contract by the customer: Creation of a community by an owner on behalf of a customer

When a registered user creates an instance of Unaty for an organization, he or she creates a community. When you create a Community, invite Users to that Community, or use or allow use of that Community after being notified of a change to these Customer Terms, you are confirming your acceptance of the then-current Agreement and agreeing to enter into the Agreement on behalf of the Customer, which is most often the organization representing the Community. Before using the Services, please make sure that you have the necessary authorization to enter into the contract on behalf of the Customer. The online functions to create a community are not a legally binding offer, but a non-binding option. By clicking the button &quot;Create Community&quot; or &quot;New Community&quot; you submit a binding order to use the Unaty Community Services. The confirmation of receipt of the order immediately after sending the order and does not yet constitute acceptance of the contract. We will confirm your order and the mutual binding nature of this contract by sending an order confirmation by e-mail within 3 business days. The text of the contract will be stored after the conclusion of the contract and can be retrieved by the customer from Untay Technologies GmbH at any time.

## Use of the services

### The owner as the role of the customer&#39;s representative in the community

When you create a community, you are assigned the role of &quot;Owner&quot; within the community. If the customer is an organization, the owner is always the representative of the customer or organization who signs this contract for the customer. The Owner role can be assigned to another representative of the customer. The role of the Owner includes special administrative rights for the Community, which include closing the Community and deleting all Community data. If the customer chooses to replace You as the representative with ultimate Owner authority for the Community, We will notify You accordingly upon such a decision. You agree to take actions reasonably requested by us or the customer to facilitate the transfer of authority to a new representative of the customer. If you are our customer as an individual, then the role of Owner is synonymous with the customer.

### Members of the community

Persons authorized by Customer to access the Services via a Community invitation (&quot;Members&quot;) may transmit and store content or information such as messages or files (&quot;Member Data&quot;) using the Services. The customer can only give us instructions on how to handle it. For example, a customer can grant or revoke access to the Services, enable or disable third-party integration of the Services, manage permissions, retention, and export settings through the role of Owner in the Community. Because these choices and instructions may result in access to or use, disclosure, editing, or deletion of some or all Member Data, please let us speak before requesting such changes.

The Owner, on behalf of the Customer, will inform Authorized Members of all policies and practices of the Customer relevant to the use of the Services and of any settings that may affect the processing of Member Data, and will ensure that the transfer and processing of Member Data under the Agreement is lawful and in accordance with their consent. On Unaty, you have the ability to manage terms of use and privacy policies for your members. Details on how to manage your community&#39;s privacy on Unaty can be found in the Community Privacy Policy Help [currently under construction].

The following provisions apply to software errors:

We undertake the analysis and elimination of documented, reproducible errors of the SaaS solution (hereinafter &quot;support services&quot;) by competent personnel. We do not vouch for the success in the elimination of errors and in this respect do not assume any warranty. &quot;Error&quot; in the sense of these Terms and Conditions is any malfunction reported by the Customer that results in the condition and functionality deviating from the offer and user documentation, and

- this has a more than an insignificant effect on their serviceability, or
- Corruption of data or loss of data processed with or generated by the SaaS solution occurs.
- If a malfunction that has occurred cannot be reproduced, it is not considered a fault. In this case, the parties will jointly agree on the further procedure.

The report can initially be made verbally but must be repeated in text form (e-mail) no later than the next business day. We are available to receive error reports Monday through Friday from 08:00 to 18:00 CET.

In the event of error messages, the activities described below are performed within the response time. The response time depends on the error class; the following error classes apply.

- Error class 1: Productive use of the SaaS solution is not possible or only possible to a significantly limited extent, or essential performance features are missed.
- Error class 2: The core functionality is ensured, but there is a significant fault in a submodule that prevents or significantly restricts working with this module.
- Error class 3: All other errors

Within the following response times, we will submit a proposal for correcting the error:

- Error class 1: 16 hours
- Error class 2: 48 hours
- Error class 3: 5 working days

We are not obligated to provide support services:

- in the event of errors based on unauthorized modifications or adaptations of the SaaS solution;
- for other software (especially third-party software used on customer systems);
- in the event of errors resulting from improper or unauthorized use of the SaaS solution or operating errors;
- for any hardware defects;
- when using the SaaS solution on other than the permitted hardware and operating system environments specified in the user documentation;
- in the form of on-site visits by our employees.

We are entitled to treat such services as a separate order and to invoice them at the usage fees for SaaS solutions following the applicable service rates.

The aforementioned services are conclusive. Beyond this, we are not obligated to provide any further services, in particular installation, adaptation, programming, consulting, and training services.

### Duty to cooperate

Any cooperation required for the performance of the contractual services shall be provided in full and in a timely manner. The customer&#39;s duties to cooperate shall include the following activities in particular:

- all applicable laws and other legal provisions must be observed during use. It is forbidden to transfer data or content to our servers that violates legal regulations or infringes on third-party property rights or copyrights or other rights of third parties. In particular, the commandments and prohibitions of the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct are to be followed and enforced to the best of one&#39;s ability within one&#39;s own community.
- in the event of an error message from the platform, screenshots, error logs and other information relevant to troubleshooting must be provided to us without delay

## Terms of payment

### Payment methods

As payment methods, we currently offer payment by direct debit and credit card. Invoices are payable after the due date - usually with delivery - without deduction. Payments are processed by our payment service provider Stripe (Stripe, Incorporated, 510 Townsend Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA). Invoices and reminders are generated automatically and sent by e-mail. Fees for reminders and return debit notes will be charged in case of default.

Delivery shall be made at the respective applicable gross final price (net price plus statutory value-added tax). We expressly reserve the right to adjust the respective prices for the products appropriately on an annual basis, even in the case of existing subscription/update services. This right to adjust prices shall also apply in particular in the event of verifiable increases in programming, maintenance, or labor costs.

The customer is not entitled to withhold payments unless he is entitled to a statutory right of retention from the same contractual relationship. Offsetting is only permitted insofar as the claim being offset is undisputed or has been legally established. Costs for unauthorized return debit notes shall be borne by the customer.

### Cooperation with our payment service provider

A transfer of your personal data as a customer to third parties usually only occurs with your express consent according to Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 a) GDPR in the form of our order data processing (see order data processing agreement for customers). Excluded from this and therefore listed separately at this point is the transfer of data to our payment service provider Stripe. In this case, your data is transferred to fulfill the contract following Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 b) GDPR. The following partly personal data of the customer organization and your legal representative (the owner) are transferred here:

- Inventory data (e.g., names, addresses),
- Contact information (e.g., email, phone numbers),
- Contract data (e.g., subject matter of the contract, term, customer category),
- Payment data (e.g., bank details, payment history) and
- Usage data (e.g., number of emails sent, number of administrators, access times).

In these cases, we strictly observe the requirements of the GDPR, as do our partners.

## Cancellation and termination

### Contract period

The usage options are designed as a subscription with a term that can expire or be terminated. The contract remains valid until all subscriptions concluded under the contract have expired or have been terminated or the contract itself ends. Termination of the contract will result in the termination of all subscriptions.

| **Usage option** | **Subscription term** | **Cancellation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | Monthly or yearly depending on the deal | Anytime effective at the end of the month |
| Professional | Monthly or yearly depending on the deal | Anytime effective at the end of the month |
| (More) | Individual according to agreement | Individual according to agreement |

The respective contract period and usage option can be selected by the owner after the creation of the community and can be changed at any time with effect from the beginning of the contract period.

### Ordinary termination for cause

We or Customer may terminate the Agreement by notice to the other party if the other party commits a material breach of the Agreement and such breach is not cured within thirty (30) days after notice of the breach is given by the non-breaching party.

### Ordinary termination without reason

Customers may cancel their subscriptions immediately without giving any reason, and the cancellation will be effective at the end of the month. Unaty may also terminate the customer&#39;s subscriptions without reason but will notify the customer in writing thirty (30) days in advance.

### Consequences of termination

In the event of termination for cause by Customer, we will refund to Customer all prepaid fees for the remainder of the term of all subscriptions after the effective date of termination. In the event of termination for cause by us, the customer shall pay any unpaid fees for the remainder of the term of such subscriptions after the effective date of termination. In no event shall termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees due for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

### Extraordinary termination

The right of both parties to terminate for cause remains unaffected. In particular, we shall be entitled to terminate this contract extraordinarily without notice if

- the customer is in arrears with the payment of an amount for more than two months, which is at least equal to the agreed fee for the use for two months,
- insolvency proceedings or other judicial or extrajudicial proceedings for the settlement of debts have been or will be instituted against the customer&#39;s assets,
- the user account has been transferred or the access data to the SaaS solution has been made accessible to third parties without our prior consent,
- the customer or one of its authorized members violates the Terms of Use for Users or the Unaty + Community Code of Conduct,
- the customer has violated its obligations under this contract in other respects and, despite being set a deadline with the threat of refusal, does not cease the violation of the contract or provide evidence of measures suitable to exclude the repetition of the violation of the contract in the future.

Customer is responsible for its Authorized Members, including for any violations of this Agreement caused by its Authorized Members. We may terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to Customer if we have reasonable grounds to believe that the Services are being used by Customer or its Authorized Users in violation of applicable law.

### Termination

In the event of termination of the contractual relationship, for whatever legal reason, the parties are obliged to wind up the contractual relationship in an orderly manner. For this purpose, we shall

- hand over the data stored by us within the scope of the contract as well as any databases created within the scope of the contractual relationship to the customer or a third party designated by the customer at its own expense no later than four weeks after the termination of the contract, either by way of remote data transfer or on data carriers, at the customer&#39;s choice
- delete the data immediately after confirmation of successful data transfer and destroy all copies made.
- or, at the customer&#39;s option, without deleting data, restrict access to a read-only authorization for the duration of the retention obligations under commercial and tax law.

We can provide additional support services for the migration of data based on a separate order. Such additional support services will be negotiated individually and remunerated accordingly.

## Liability

We shall be liable for all damages arising in connection with this contract, regardless of the factual or legal grounds, only following these provisions:

- In the event of intent and gross negligence, claims under the German Product Liability Act, and injury to life or health, we shall be liable without limitation in accordance with the statutory provisions.
- Otherwise, the liability per calendar year is limited to a) the damage foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the contract up to a total amount for all cases of damage per calendar year, and b) to the remuneration amount paid by the customer in this calendar year. This limitation of liability shall also apply in the event of data loss and data deterioration.
- Otherwise, the liability per calendar year is limited to the damage foreseeable at the time of the conclusion of the contract up to a total amount of the remuneration paid in this calendar year for all cases of damage per calendar year. This limitation of liability shall also apply in the event of data loss and data deterioration.

## Retention of title and copyrights/rights of use

### Retention of title

The unrestricted ownership until the complete fulfillment of all payment obligations remains reserved. In the case of deliveries/services to resellers, the latter shall be entitled to resell in the ordinary course of business. In principle, he is authorized to collect the receivables. By way of security, the reseller shall assign all claims against its customers in the amount of the invoice value of the goods (extended reservation of title).

### Copyright and rights of use

Upon conclusion of the contract, the customer is granted the right to use the services on the online platform within the scope of the statutory provisions.

For the services on our online platform, the non-transferable and non-exclusive rights of use are only transferred for a limited period, the duration of the agreed term of this contract. The right of use is limited to the use described in this contract.

### Rights to improvement suggestions

Suggestions for improvement from all users are very welcome to Unaty. If a customer, member, or user sends us feedback or suggestions about the Services, we may use them. Therefore, customer (for itself and any of its Authorized Users and other members of the customer&#39;s organization) grants us an unlimited, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicensable, transferable, royalty-free license to use such feedback or suggestions for any purpose whatsoever, without incurring any obligation on our part or any claim for indemnification by the customer, any authorized user or any other member of customer&#39;s organizations.

## Confidentiality

The contracting parties shall be obliged to treat the information made available to them as confidential under this Agreement by the respective other party as well as knowledge which they acquire on the occasion of this cooperation concerning matters of a technical, commercial, or organizational nature of the respective other contracting party and not to exploit or use it or make it available to third parties during the term and after the termination of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the party concerned. The disclosure to third parties who are subject to a legal obligation to maintain confidentiality is not subject to consent. The disclosure to employees who require the information for their activities in the performance of services under the contract shall also not require consent. However, the parties shall ensure that such employees are bound by corresponding confidentiality obligations. Any use of such information shall be limited solely to use for the performance of this Agreement. Each party shall inform the other party immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized disclosures or possible loss of confidential information.

This aforementioned obligation does not apply to information that is demonstrably

- the other party has lawfully received or will receive from third parties,
- were already generally known at the time this Agreement was concluded or subsequently became generally known without any breach of this confidentiality obligation,
- already existed previously at the party receiving this information, or
- already developed at the party receiving this information independently of the communication.

The prohibition of disclosure shall not apply insofar as the parties are obliged to disclose the information by law, by a court, or administrative orders. In this case, however, the party obligated to disclose shall be obligated to notify the other party in advance of the disclosure of the information so that the other party has the opportunity to defend against and prevent or limit such disclosure. The party obligated to disclose shall use its best efforts concerning the governmental authorities ordering the disclosure to ensure that all Confidential Information to be disclosed is kept confidential.

The confidentiality obligations of this contract shall continue to exist for 2 years after termination of this contract. For data that is subject to special data secrecy or professional secrecy, the confidentiality obligation shall apply for an unlimited time.

## Emails and Unaty notifications

Unless otherwise specified herein, notices under this Agreement will be given by email. Alternatively, we may instead notify customers through the Services (e.g., through a Unaty notification). Notices to Unaty shall be sent to hey@getunaty.com. Notice shall be deemed to have been duly delivered (a) in the case of notices by email, on the day after the email is sent, or (b) in the case of notices through the Services, on the day on which the notice is given.

## Changes to the terms and conditions for customers

The validity of conflicting or deviating terms and conditions is excluded, even if we do not expressly object to them or accept services without reservation. Subject to the following provisions, we reserve the right to amend these Terms and Conditions for Customers, provided that such amendment is reasonable for the Customer, taking into account the interests of us; this is particularly the case if the amendment is without significant legal or economic disadvantages for the Customer, e.g., in the case of changes to the user interface of all functions or changes to functional processes. Otherwise, we will inform the Owner as the Customer&#39;s representative before any change to these Terms and Conditions with reasonable advance notice, but at least one month before the intended effective date. The information will be sent to the email address designated by the Owner. If the Customer does not agree with any change we intend to make, the Customer has the right to object to the change within one month of notification. If you object in due time, we are entitled to terminate the contract in writing with a notice period of one month to the end of the calendar month.

The customer will keep its billing and contact information up to date at all times by notifying Unaty of any changes. Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void.
