#### General information

Data collected:

So-called cookies are set when you visit our websites. These are small text files that are stored on your terminal device. Cookies usually contain a characteristic sequence of characters, the so-called cookieID, with which your browser can be identified when you visit our website again.

In addition, we use so-called tags, which are small code elements that help us measure the behavior of our visitors and the success of advertising activities.

Depending on the type of cookies or tags, different data is collected and processed pseudonymously.

We use both our own cookies and cookies from other providers (third-party cookies). The third-party cookies are shown in detail below.

Purposes of data processing:

Technically necessary cookies enable the technical functioning of the website. Some functions of our websites cannot be offered without the use of cookies.

Functionality cookies are used to make our websites more user-friendly and to ensure certain functionalities, e.g. the storage of your login data so that you can access the data and settings you have already entered when you return to the site.

Analytics cookies and tags allow us to generate aggregate statistics, for example, about the number of views, which areas of the websites are viewed most frequently, and information about locations and about the duration of the average stay on the websites. This allows us to improve the quality of our websites and content.

We currently do not use advertising cookies and retargeting technologies.

We use technically necessary cookies and functionality cookies based on legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR). Our legitimate interest is to ensure the functioning of our websites and their optimal usability.

We use analytics cookies and tags based on legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 f GDPR, recital 47). Our legitimate interest is to tailor our websites optimally to the interests of our customers.

Storage duration and control options:

Some of the cookies we use are automatically deleted after you close your browser (so-called session cookies), others remain permanently on your terminal device and allow us to recognize your browser (so-called persistent cookies).

You have full control over the use of cookies and can delete cookies in your browser, disable the storage of cookies altogether or selectively accept certain cookies. Please use the help functions of your browser to learn how to change these settings. This may limit the functionality of our websites.

#### Third-party cookie technologies used: Google

Google Tag Manager: The Google Tag Manager helps us set and manage tags. Your data is not collected by the service. We ensure this through the anonymous mode of the Tag Manager, which is set by default on getunaty.com.

Purposes of data processing:

Google Tag Manager: We use this service to create, extract and manage tags on our website.

Google Fonts: We use this service to be able to use an extended selection of fonts on our website.

## Collection of personal data when contacting Unaty via the website

### Contact

#### Data collected:

We collect and process the data you provide, such as your contact details, your name, and your request, when you contact us via a contact form or by e-mail. All data that you transmit to us is encrypted and transferred between your browser and our server.

G Suite: We use G Suite as a solution for internal and external communication. For example, if you send us an email to our support or privacy mailbox, it will be stored and processed in a G Suite (Gmail) mailbox. These accesses are made through contractual arrangements based on an appropriate level of data protection. When using G Suite, it cannot be ruled out that the relevant employees of the partner Google Inc. (USA) or its subsidiaries and subcontractors may become aware of this data. Consequently, the data is also collected, processed, and used in countries outside the European Union and the European Economic Area.

#### Purposes of data processing:

The data processing is carried out by our customer service or service providers commissioned by us exclusively for the processing of your request.

#### Legal basis:

We process your data to carry out pre-contractual and contractual measures that are carried out at your request (Art. 6 para. 1 b GDPR).

#### Storage period:

We store your data for as long as we need it for the specific processing purpose, for warranty purposes or to comply with legal retention periods.

### Receive newsletter and updates

#### Data collected:

We collect and process the data you provide, such as your name and their email address, when you order our newsletter or news (&quot;updates&quot;).

Mailchimp: We only transfer the email address you provide to receive these messages to the online marketing platform Mailchimp, which is operated by The Rocket Science Group LLC, a company headquartered at 675 Ponce de Leon Ave NE; Suite 5000; Atlanta, GA 30308 USA. This constitutes a transfer of personal data to a country outside the EU. We have entered into a data processing agreement with Mailchimp to ensure the lawful processing of this data and to guarantee your rights to this data.

We use tracking technologies in our newsletter. With the help of these technologies, data is collected about whether our emails are opened, and which links are being clicked.

#### Purposes of data processing:

We process the data to send you the newsletter or updates.

Mailchimp: We use Mailchimp to manage an email list of newsletters and update prospects and to be able to deliver this information requested by you via email.

We use the data we collect to find out what topics are of interest to you. We then use this information to improve the emails we send you and the services we provide, and to combine it with tracking or profiling information we already have.

#### Legal basis:

The receipt of newsletters and updates is only at your request. If you order a newsletter, we process your data with your consent to inform you by electronic mail about tips on the use of Unaty and selected news and also to address advertising. We work according to the double opt-in principle, i.e. if you order the newsletter or updates, we will send you a confirmation e-mail with a registration link. Only when you click on this link, you are on our newsletter list.

We thus use Mailchimp also based on your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 GDPR). You give us your consent by entering your email address and then clicking on the button to order the newsletter or updates in a double opt-in email.

#### Storage duration and control options:

We store your data for as long as we need it for the respective, specific processing purpose.

You can object to the processing of your email address by Mailchimp by unsubscribing from the newsletter or updates. A corresponding link is included at the end of each message.

## Conclusion of contract and consent to this privacy policy

You will be prompted to accept the privacy policy and the use of the data collection and technologies listed here via a green banner when you visit our website (Process A, see Overview and Definitions). Before you accept, only the technically necessary technologies will be used to enable you to visit the website. This excludes data collection with a different trigger, specifically contacting us and receiving newsletters and updates. These are only used and accepted by you when you contact us or request a newsletter or updates.

## Rights of data subjects and how they can be exercised

You have the following rights as a data subject when your data is collected by Unaty:

### A. Revocation of consent

You may revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data at any time with effect for the future. Please note that the revocation has no effect on the lawfulness of the previous data processing and that it does not extend to data processing for which there is a legal obligation and which may therefore also be processed without your consent.

### B. Further data subject rights

In addition, you are entitled to the following data subject rights following Articles 15 to 21 and 77 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) if the legal requirements are met:

#### Information

You can request at any time that we provide you with information about which of your personal data we process and provide a copy of the personal data we have stored about you, Art. 15 GDPR.

#### Correction:

You can request the correction of inaccurate personal data and the completion of incomplete personal data from us, Art. 16 GDPR.

#### Deletion

You can request the deletion of your personal data. Please note:

a) Parts of our services can no longer be provided after the deletion of your personal data.

b) Excluded from the deletion is data that we need for the implementation and execution of contracts and for the assertion, exercise, and defense of legal claims, as well as data for which there are legal, regulatory, or contractual retention obligations, Art. 17 GDPR.

#### Restriction of processing

You can request the restriction of processing under certain circumstances, e.g. if you believe that your data is incorrect, if the processing is unlawful or if you have objected to the data processing. This means that your data may only be processed in a very restricted manner without your consent, e.g. for the assertion, exercise, and defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of other natural and legal persons, Art. 18 GDPR.

#### Objection to data processing

You have the option to object to data processing for direct marketing purposes at any time. In addition, you can object at any time to data processing based on a legitimate interest if there are special reasons, Art. 21 GDPR.

#### Data portability

You have the right to receive the data that you have provided to us and that we process based on your consent or for the performance of a contract in a common, machine-readable format and to request, within the limits of what is technically feasible, direct transmission of this data to third parties, Art. 20 GDPR.
